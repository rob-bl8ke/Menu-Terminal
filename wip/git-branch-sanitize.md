To achieve this task in PowerShell, you can create a script that takes the issue description, removes special characters, and creates a Git feature branch. Below is an example script to get you started:

```powershell
# Function to sanitize string by removing special characters and replacing spaces with dashes
function Sanitize-String {
    param (
        [string]$inputString
    )
    # Replace special characters with dashes
    $sanitizedString = $inputString -replace '[^\w\s-]', ''
    # Replace spaces with dashes
    $sanitizedString = $sanitizedString -replace '\s', '-'
    # Remove consecutive dashes
    $sanitizedString = $sanitizedString -replace '-+', '-'
    # Trim leading and trailing dashes
    $sanitizedString = $sanitizedString.Trim('-')
    $sanitizedString = $sanitizedString.ToLower()
    return $sanitizedString
}

# Function to create Git feature branch
function Create-Git-Feature-Branch {
    param (
        [string]$branchName
    )
    # Checkout to main branch (change 'main' to your default branch name)
    git checkout main
    # Pull latest changes from remote
    git pull origin main
    # Create and checkout new feature branch
    git checkout -b $branchName
    # Push feature branch to remote (change 'origin' to your remote name)
    git push origin $branchName
}

# Example issue description
$issueDescription = "This is a test issue description! It contains special characters: ?!$& and spaces."

# Sanitize issue description
$sanitizedDescription = Sanitize-String -inputString $issueDescription

# Create Git feature branch
Create-Git-Feature-Branch -branchName $sanitizedDescription
```

This script defines two functions:

1. `Sanitize-String`: This function takes an input string (`$inputString`) and removes special characters, replaces spaces with dashes, removes consecutive dashes, and trims leading and trailing dashes.

2. `Create-Git-Feature-Branch`: This function creates a Git feature branch with the given branch name. It checks out to the main branch, pulls the latest changes, creates a new feature branch with the sanitized branch name, and pushes the branch to the remote repository.

You can customize and integrate these functions into your PowerShell script or automation pipeline to suit your specific requirements.
